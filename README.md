### What I learned

I am watching [Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys&t=74915s) and I have finished it. This is the last challenge in the course, and I try to apply contents from the course into it which is closer to reality.
Here are some key points
1. Fundamental of html
2. Fundamental of css
3. Flexbox

### Continued development

1. React
2. Maybe some CSS frameworks
